# CroqPain
Where's the Next CroqPain

According to the model and prediction result, we highly recommend that Craq'pain should take the following factors into consideration when selecting location for new stores: capital investment, regional income level, restaurant size, the proportion of residents aging from 35-44 in the region and the number of non-restaurant business per person in the region.

To reach performance ratio goal and achieve future success for new restaurants, we recommend choosing ‘Toulouse’ and ‘Montpellier’ to invest.
